# High-Level-Synthesis-of-ML-models-for-implementation-on-FPGA

# Project Objective:
This project involves high-level synthesis (HLS) of machine learning models for implementation on FPGAs.on a given ml  model, and the objective is to convert the
model to C using Keras2C perform HLS using Vivado HLS, and compare results with the results obtained
through HLS4ml.

# Tools:
1.Keras2C : Generates C from the Keras model.

2.Vivado HLS : Used to perform HLS.

3.HLS4ML

# Execution and Conversion
run assigned models with Keras2C to generate C files. These files will then be synthesized
with Vivado HLS. Results has to be compared with the ones generated using HLS4ml.

# Optimization and Analysis
Optimization pragmas will be applied to the C files to improve performance. A detailed report on synthesis
parameters such as latency and resource utilization has been prepared.

# Conclusion
This project aims to explore HLS techniques for ML models and assess their performance on FPGA platforms.
